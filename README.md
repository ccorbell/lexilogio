# lexilogio

A python-based flashcard learning system that supports categories, tags, and a spaced repetition algorithm.

I am developing this this application for personal language learning and vocabulary building.

Currently this app provides an interactive text API. It requires a current Python 3 version.
Lexilogio uses sqlite3, with a single flashcard deck stored in a single database file. 
Entries may be imported from text files. Exports and merges are TBD. GUI also TBD.

More documentation forthcoming! This should be considered unstable at present, some database 
schema revisions are planned in upcoming commits.
